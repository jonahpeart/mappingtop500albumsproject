Albums can be recorded at many studios. 
Each marker on the map indicates one studio where 
an album was recorded (or partly recorded).
To see the other studios an album was recorded, 
hover over the “other studios” dropdown.
Some studio locations are private or there is 
simply not enough information to properly geocode. 
In the dropdown menu, studios that appear in blue 
have a known location. Once clicked, the map will 
take you to its location. Studios with an unknown 
location appear in a black font and, if applicable, 
a rough location of that studio is provided in parentheses.

      <p class="info-modal-text">
Click the <span class="material-symbols-outlined">info</span>
 in the bottom right of each marker popup to see the 
 source of the information. Many of the sources were 
 extracted from liner notes or credits that were provided 
 by Discogs. In addition, Wikipedia often provides a 
 list of studios. In the case of Wikipedia, page sources 
 were consulted to ensure the information was legitimate. 
 In certain cases, such as Bob Dylan or The Beatles albums, 
 a book was the source. Keep in mind that the information 
 is not exhaustive and not all studio locations are verified 
 and are subject to potential errors. I tried my best to 
 diligently research and locate these studios.
          </p>
      <p class="info-modal-text">
It is important to note that the complete production of an 
album can take place at many studios. To illustrate, an 
album can be mixed, mastered, pressed, and cut at many 
different locations. Only the studios at which the albums 
were recorded were included. In addition, there are a 
few albums where no studios have a known location. 
In this case, they do not appear anywhere on the map.

This project is based on The Rolling Stone's Top 500 Albums 
of All Time list. Full credit is given to Rolling Stone for 
curating the original list. Additional thanks to Discogs for 
their comprehensive database of album and recording information 
and Leaflet for providing a free, open-source framework for 
interactive web mapping. It truly is an amazing library. 
This map was created for educational and informational 
purposes only. All rights to the album data and associated 
information remain with their respective owners.
