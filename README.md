This project is based on The Rolling Stone's Top 500 Albums of All Time list. Full credit is given to Rolling Stone for curating the original list. Additional thanks to Discogs for their comprehensive database of album and recording information and Leaflet for providing a free, open-source framework for interactive web mapping. It truly is an amazing library. This map was created for educational and informational purposes only. All rights to the album data and associated information remain with their respective owners.
